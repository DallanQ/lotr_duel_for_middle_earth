## CHAPTER OVERVIEW (page 3)

### Preparing a chapter (page 3)

At the start of each chapter (1, 2, then 3), place cards from the corresponding chapter **in the central play area**, following the diagram below (*reminder on the sides of the box*). Be careful, since certain cards are placed faceup and others facedown. Place the 3 remaining cards, facedown, in the discard.

### Turn overview (page 3)

The Sauron player begins the game, then both players **take turns**, until the end of the game. On your turn, you may either **take a Chapter card** or **take a Landmark tile**.

#### A. Take a Chapter card (page 3)

From the central play area, choose an **available** card, meaning one that is not partially covered by any other cards. Then, play it in front of you or discard it.

> image of a tan and brown cards arranged in rows. With a green mark check showing the available cards.

##### PLAY THE CARD IN FRONT OF YOU (PAGE 3)

Pay the card cost, if any (see page 4), and place it in your pay area. You may immediately benefit from its effect. 
(see page 5). 

*Note: Stack cards in front of you by color, making sure you can steill see their effects.*

**or**

##### DISCARD THE CARD (page3)

Place the card, facedown, in the discard and take as many Coins from the reserve as the current chapter.

- Chapter 1: 1 Coin
- Chapter 2: 2 Coins
- Chapter 3: 3 Coins

Finally end your turn by revealing any cards that are now available. 

#### B. Take a Landmark tile (page 3)

Choose one of the faceup tiles. Pay its cost (see page 4) and place it in your play area.
Immediately place a Fortress pawn on the corresponding region of the central board and benefit from its other effects *(see the Player Aid).*
Finally, end your turn without revealing a new tile.

### End of a chapter (page3)

A chapter ends **once the final card of this chapter has been taken**.
Set up the cards for the next chapter according to the corresponding diagram and reveal new Landmark tiles until there are, if possible, 3 faceup. 
Then continue the game as normal.

*Note: Since you alternate taking turns, the player who ends a chapter does not begin the next one, unless they are using a “Take another turn” effect (see the Player Aid).*

## CARDS AND TILES COSTS (page 4)

### Coins (page 4)
In order to play them, certain cards have a Coin cost that you must pay to the reserve.

> image of a blue chapter card with a gold ring at the top. A white square at the center of the card with a coin on it.

### Skills (page 4)

In order to play them, tiles and the majority of cards require you to have one or more Skills (*see page 5*) in your play area. If you do not have the required Skills, you may pay **1 Coin** to the reserve **per missing Skill symbol**.

> image of a red chapter card with a white rectangle in the middle of the card  with 3 icons. The first icon is a face with two colours black and white which is a Ruse, the second is Strength icon and the third is Courage icon. 

*Notes*:
- *There is no limit to the number of Skills you may pay for, to the reserve, on your turn*.
- *If a card does not require a Skill or a Coin, it has no cost, so you may play it for free*.

(image of a yellow circle icon with a castle on it). Landmark tiles have an additional Coin cost equal to the number of **your Fortress pawns** already on the central board.Therefore, the additional cost of your first tile is 0 Coins.
(image of a  white square  with a yellow circle that has a castle on it, and 3 strength icon, with a 2 crown icon and a book icon. Directly below it is a grey castle pointing to a brown scroll with stack cards pointing to a card with a lost coin on it.)

### Chaining (page 4)

Starting in chapter 2, certain cards may be played for free through their **chaining symbol**. If you have, in your play area, a card with a matching symbol in its top-right corner, you may play the card for free, without having the required Skills.

*Note: If you do not have the matching chaining symbol for a card, you may still play it normally by paying its Skill
and/or Coin cost.*

*Example:*

> image of a chapter card with 3 icons and a white square on the right corner of the card labelled 2 on the top of the card. A white rectangle below the icons with 1 labelled below.

*In chapter 1, you play this card for free 1*.
*In addition to its effect (see page 5), it has a chaining symbol 2*.

> image of a chapter card with 4 icons at the top, with a white square symbol labelled 3 and a white rectangle symbol with 3 icons on it labelled 4 below. Below are warriors on the castle in the rain.

In chapter 2, you may play this card for free since you have the matching chaining symbol 3 on one of your played cards.
Otherwise, you would need to have the required Skills (or pay 1 Coin per missing Skill symbol) 4.

## CARD AND TILE EFFECTS (page 5)

- **Grey cards** (> image of a Rhombus) provide Skills that let you play other cards and tiles in your play area.
You gain **1 Skill per symbol** shown. Each symbol may only be used **once per turn**, on each of your turns.

> image of a Ruse icon, Strength icon,  Courage icon, Knowledge icon, Leadership icon.

(image of a knowledge icon/ and a leadership icon) When multiple Skills are separated by a /, you may only use **one of them** per turn (you choose).

- **Yellow cards** (image of a circle) immediately provide Coins that you will be able to spend to play other cards and tiles
in your play area.

(an image of a coin with 2 on it) Take, from the reserve, the number of Coins shown in the symbol.

- **Blue cards** (image of aa yellow card) immediately let you advance on the Quest of the Ring track.

(image of a golden ring) Move your character along the Quest of the Ring track, one space per Ring symbol.

- **Green cards** (image of a yellow triangle) represent the Races of Middle-earth with whom you may ally.

> image of an Elves icon, Ents icon, Hobbits icon, Humans icon, Dwarves icon, Wizards icon).

- **Red cards** (image of a yellow X) immediately let you place Units in the regions of Middle-earth (see page 7).
Choose **one of the two regions** shown by the banners and place **all Units** in the chosen region.

> icon of a blue banner icon with an arror below showing the *choice of region where you may place units*, a hand icon with a 2 on it and an arrow at the top showing the *Number of Units to place*. A purple banner icon

- **Purple cards** (image of a star) (only available in chapter 3) immediately let you complete various maneuvers.

(image of an arror) Move 1 of your Units to an adjacent region. (image of a coin wih a red X on it), Your opponent loses 1 Coin.
(image of a hand icon with red X on it), Remove 1 enemy Unit from any region.

- **Landmark tiles** immediately let you place Fortresses in regions of Middle-earth (see page 7) and benefit from unique effects *(see the Player Aid)*.

> image of a castle pointing to a brown banner with an arror showing the *Region where you may place a Fortress*

## QUEST OF THE RING (page 6)

> image of a Quest Ring Track with icons at the lower part with lots of labelled arrows.

When you advance on the Quest of the Ring track, slide your character (Frodo and Sam for the Fellowship or the Nazgûl for Sauron) from space to space.
When you **reach or pass** a Bonus space, you may immediately benefit from its effect (*see the Player Aid*).

*Note: The piece that represents the Nazgûl is placed on top of the piece that represents Frodo and Sam. Therefore, when Frodo
and Sam move, the Nazgûl automatically moves as well. In other words, the distance between the characters will only decrease, never increase*.

> image of a blue chapter card with 2 gold rings at the upper part of it followed by 2 strength icons and a knowledge icon below it alongside a track with a red "X" which marks the starting point on the left. There’s a yellow-highlighted circle labeled "1", with arrows and numbers "2" and "3" around it, suggesting a sequence of moves. Frodo and Sam are positioned above this yellow circle, indicating the current position on the track. The background is a mountainous landscape. 

*Example: As the Fellowship player, you play a Blue card with 2 Rings^1 that lets you move Frodo and Sam 2 spaces 2. They pass a Bonus space 3, which lets you benefit from its effect (in this case, take 1 Coin from the reserve)*.

## RACE ALLIANCES (page 6)

During the game, you may form alliances with the Races of Middle-earth. To do this, in your play area, play **Green cards** with matching or different Race symbols, according to the following conditions:

##### MARCHING RACE SYMBOLS (page 6)

As soon as you have 2 matching Race symbols, take the top 2 Alliance tokens of this Race and **reveal them**.
Choose 1 to place in front of you; you may now benefit from its effect (*see the Player Aid*). Put the other token, facedown, on **top** of its stack.

**or**

##### 3 DIFFERENT RACE SYMBOLS (page 6)
**Once per game**, when you have 3 different Race symbols, take the top Alliance token of each of these 3 Races and **reveal them**. Choose 1 to place in front of you; you may now benefit from its effect (*see the Player Aid*).
Put the other 2 tokens, facedown, on top of their respective stacks.

*Notes*:

- *A single Race symbol may be used for both conditions (2 matching symbols and 3 different symbols)*.
- *Reveal tokens **to both players**. There is no hidden information*.


## CONQUERING MIDDLE - EARTH (page 7)

> image of the central board  with 7 banner icons in diferent colours with the first arrow showing the *Fortress space*, second *Connection between two regions*, third *Unit space*, and fourth *Region banner*.

When you place or move one or more Units, two situations are possible:
- **If no enemy Unit is present:** nothing happens.
- **If one or more enemy Units are present:** trigger a **conflict**. Each player removes one of their Units and places it back in front of them. Repeat this until at least one player has no more Units in the region.

*Note*: *An enemy Fortress does not trigger conflicts and does not prevent you from placing your Units in its region.
Therefore, it is possible for both players to be present in the same region*.

When you complete multiple movements, you may move the same Unit multiple times, or split your movement between multiple Units. For each movement, move a Unit to an adjacent region (one with a connection). You must complete each movement independently, resolving any conflict triggered, one at a time.

> image of a purple card with 3 arrors at the upper part and 4 icons below, alongside a central board with an arror showing 3 movement from one unit space to another.

*Example: You play a Purple card that provides 3 movements 1. The first lets you move a Unit from Enedwaith to Rohan 2.
Since there is an enemy Unit present, you trigger a conflict and each player removes their Unit. You then use your second and third movements to send another Unit from Enedwaith to Mordor, passing through Rohan3*.

## END OF THE GAME (page 8)
There are three immediate victory conditions:

### Quests of the Ring (page 8)
For the Fellowship: If Frodo and Sam **reach Mount Doom** , they destroy the One Ring and you immediately win the game. 
For Sauron: If the Nazgûl **catch Frodo and Sam**, they seize the One Ring and you immediately win the game.

### Support of the Races (page 8)
If you gather **6 different Race symbols** on your **Green cards**, you rally the support of the Races of Middle-earth and immediately win the game.

*Note: The Eagle symbol, present on one Alliance token, is an additional Race symbol that counts as 1 of the 6 required
symbols for the Support of the Races victory*.

### Conquering Middle-earth 
If you are **present in all 7 regions** (with a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit), you dominate Middle-earth and immediately win the game.

If none of these three victory conditions are achieved by the end of chapter 3, the player who is **present in the most regions** of Middle-earth (with a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit) wins the game. In case of tie, share the victory.
