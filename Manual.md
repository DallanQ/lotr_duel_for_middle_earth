> image of an arrow facing downwards showing how the track pieces fit together. 

5. The Fellowship player takes **3 Coins** while the Sauron player takes **2 Coins**.Then make a **reserve** with the 
   remaining Coins.

6. Sort the **Alliance tokens** according to their backs, to make one stack per Race. Shuffle each stack separately and place them, facedown, above the central board, in the dedicated notches.

7. Shuffle the **Landmark tiles** and place 3, faceup, on the table. Make a stack, facedown, with the remaining tiles.

8. Sort the Chapter cards into 3 decks according to the runes on their backs P (1), R (2), q (3), then shuffle each deck seperately.
 
## CHAPTER OVERVIEW (page 3)

### Preparing a chapter (page 3)

At the start of each chapter (1, 2, then 3), place cards from the corresponding chapter **in the central play area**, following the diagram below (reminder on the sides of the box). Be careful, since certain cards are placed faceup and others facedown. Place the 3 remaining cards, facedown, in the discard.

> tan and dark brown cards arranged in 3 sections. First in, upward pyramid form, second in downward pyramid form and thirdly both small upward and and downward pyramid form. Each arranged card is labelled chapter 1-3. 

### Turn overview (page 3)

The Sauron player begins the game, then both players **take turns** , until the end of the game. On your turn, you may either **take a Chapter card** or **take a Landmark tile**.

#### A. Take a Chapter card (page 3)

From the central play area, choose an **available** card, meaning one that is not partially covered by any other cards. Then, play it in front of you or discard it.

> tan and brown cards arranged in rows. With a green mark check showing the available cards.

##### PLAY THE CARD IN FRONT OF YOU (PAGE 3)
Pay the card cost, if any (see page 4), and place it in your pay area. You may immediately benefit from its effect. (see page 5). 

*Note: Stack cards in front of you by color, making sure you can steill see their effects.*

**or**

##### DISCARD THE CARD (page3)

Place the card, facedown, in the discard and take as many Coins from the reserve as the current chapter.

- Chapter 1: 1 Coin
- Chapter 2: 2 Coins
- Chapter 3: 3 Coins

Finally end your turn by revealing any cards that are now available. 

#### B. Take a Landmark tile (page 3)

Choose one of the faceup tiles. Pay its cost (see page 4) and place it in your play area.
Immediately place a Fortress pawn on the corresponding region of the central board and benefit from its other effects *(see the Player Aid).*
Finally, end your turn without revealing a new tile.

### End of a chapter (page3)

A chapter ends **once the final card of this chapter has been taken**.
Set up the cards for the next chapter according to the corresponding diagram and reveal new Landmark tiles until there are, if possible, 3 faceup.
Then continue the game as normal.

*Note: Since you alternate taking turns, the player who ends a chapter does not begin the next one, unless they are using a “Take another turn” effect (see the Player Aid).*

## CARDS AND TILES COSTS
In order to play them, certain cards have a Coin cost that you must pay to the reserve.

In order to play them, tiles and the majority of cards require you to have one or more Skills ( _see page 5_ ) in your play area. If you do not have the required Skills, you may pay **1 Coin** to the reserve **per missing Skill symbol**.

> a red chapter card with a rectangle in the middle of the card  with 3 circles. The first circle has a two coloured face, the second has a hand and the third has a love with a red arrow peirced through. Below the rectangle is a beast. 

_Notes:_
-_There is no limit to the number of Skills you may pay for, to the reserve, on your turn._
-_If a card does not require a Skill or a Coin, it has no cost, so you may play it for free._

> 
Landmark tiles have an additional Coin cost equal to the number of **your Fortress pawns** already on the central board.
Therefore, the additional cost of your first tile is 0 Coins.
>

### Chaining

Starting in chapter 2, certain cards may be played for free through their **chaining symbol**. If you have, in your play area, a card with a matching symbol in its top-right corner, you may play the card for free, without having the required Skills.

_Note: If you do not have the matching chaining symbol for a card, you may still play it normally by paying its Skill
and/or Coin cost._

_Example:_

> 
In chapter 1, you play
```
## this card for free 1.

```
In addition to its effect
(see page 5), it has a chaining
```
## symbol^2.

```
In chapter 2, you may play this
card for free since you have
```
## the matching chaining symbol^3

```
on one of your played cards.
Otherwise, you would need
to have the required Skills
(or pay 1 Coin per missing Skill
```
## symbol)^4.

or _the Nazgûl_ for Sauron) from space to space.

When you **reach or pass** a Bonus space, you may immediately benefit from its effect ( _see the Player Aid_ ).

_Note: The piece that represents the Nazgûl is placed on top of the piece that represents Frodo and Sam. Therefore, when Frodo
and Sam move, the Nazgûl automatically moves as well. In other words, the distance between the characters will
only decrease, never increase._

During the game, you may form alliances with the Races of Middle-earth. To do this, in your play area,
play **Green cards** with matching or different Race symbols, according to the following conditions:

_Notes:_

_- A single Race symbol may be used for both conditions (2 matching symbols and 3 different symbols).
- Reveal tokens_ **_to both players_**_. There is no hidden information._

When you place or move one or more Units, two situations are possible:

**If no enemy Unit is present:** nothing happens.

**If one or more enemy Units are present:** trigger a **conflict**. Each player removes one of their Units
and places it back in front of them. Repeat this until at least one player has no more Units in the region.

_Note: An enemy Fortress does not trigger conflicts and does not prevent you from placing your Units in its region.
Therefore, it is possible for both players to be present in the same region._

# CONQUERING MIDDLE-EARTH

## Example: You play a Purple card that provides 3 movements 1. The first lets you move a Unit from Enedwaith to Rohan^2.

_Since there is an enemy Unit present, you trigger a conflict and each player removes their Unit. You then use_

## your second and third movements to send another Unit from Enedwaith to Mordor, passing through Rohan^3.

When you complete multiple movements, you may move the same Unit multiple times, or split your movement
between multiple Units. For each movement, move a Unit to an adjacent region (one with a connection).
You must complete each movement independently, resolving any conflict triggered, one at a time.

There are three immediate victory conditions:

## Quest of the Ring

```
For the Fellowship: If Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom , they destroy the One Ring and you immediately
win the game.
For Sauron: If the Nazgûl catch Frodo and Sam , they seize the One Ring and you immediately win the game.
```
## Support of the Races

```
If you gather 6 different Race symbols on your Green cards , you rally the support of the Races
of Middle-earth and immediately win the game.
Note: The Eagle symbol, present on one Alliance token, is an additional Race symbol that counts as 1 of the 6 required
symbols for the Support of the Races victory.
```
## Conquering Middle-earth

```
If you are present in all 7 regions (with a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit), you dominate Middle-earth
and immediately win the game.
```
If none of these three victory conditions are achieved by the end of chapter 3, the player who is **present in the most
regions** of Middle-earth (with a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit) wins the game. In case of tie, share the victory.
