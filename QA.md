> In the landmark tile, what is the use of the round symbols ?

For that first yellow one, It's a reminder that you need to pay 1 coin for each fortress you already have on the map. So for your first landmark, the round symbol costs nothing since you have no fortresses.
For the rest of the symbols, it's the cost to build. The skills required to put into play.

> When you have the halfling alliance power that grants 3 coins whenever you play a card with a chain symbol on it. When does that trigger?
> 1. When you play a card with a chain symbol at the top right of it (the chain trigger)
> 2. When you play a card with a chain symbol that shows the replacement, cost on the left middle of the card (the chain resolution)
> 3. Or both?

The ability says:
"When you play a card using a chaining
symbol, take 3 Coins from the reserve."

"Using" chaining symbol, not "with" chaining symbol anywhere on it - so it's your option #2: whenever you play a new card for free because you have the required card to chain it from, and avoid the resource requirements/cost.

> Does the Sauron player always go first in chapter 1,2,3

The turn order carries on between chapters. So if player A is the last active player in chapter 1, player B will start chapter 2. But if a player is the last active in chapter 1 and gets an extra turn playing the last card, he starts the next chapter. But don't forget there's no obligation to take an extra turn.

> Let's say I play green card. As a consequence I choose Dwarves token "When you play a Green card, also complete 2 movements on the central board.". Do I get 2 movements right now or only next time green card is played?

No, because you already played the green card BEFORE the token's ability became active.
You only trigger the effect from the Dwarves token after you have the token. Get the token first and thereafter drawing green cards triggers it.

No it doesn't. 
Eagle only count as a race symbol when you check the race victory.
It doesn't count for the 3 different races bonus.

> If you buy the Grey Havens landmark do you have to pick the top 2 token from the same race and then choose one? Or can you pick 1 top token from a race and 1 top token from another race (then choose one)?

The "top 2 tokens of any race" should be from the same race. This is easy to catch, because this shouldn't allow you to take 12 tokens, just 2. If it's not like this, the wording could be better.

> can you play a landmark and therefore place a fortress in a place with enemy units already present there?

Yes, opponent Fortresses and units may coexist, just opponent units get into conflict.

No, that won't happen. The Nazgul player track spaces aren't translucent and will cover/nullify the ones on the fellowship track. In other words, both tracks have the same spaces and bonuses, move together but they remain independent. The fellowship track is printed on the cardboard and the Nazgul one on the acrylic, so over the "chasing flavor" they act separately.

The tracks are overlaid but Sauron's is printed on the acrylic overlay and Sam/Frodo's is printed on the actual board. The bonus one player receives doesn't trigger at the same time as another, they're independent.

The number of armies in supply is not supposed to be limited, therefore you would need to use a dice or token or something to represent your missing army piece until you could switch it out for an actual piece, in this example though the suitable replacement piece would be on the board for literally a second as its just going to get removed/replaced instantly. Place all 3 (2 pieces and 1 suitable replacement piece), killing 2 enemy units and 2 of your own, leave 1 piece on the board and return 1 to your supply, completely removing the suitable replacement piece as its no longer required.

> When you pick and play a race token it says that you may benefit from its effect. Does that mean:
1) You may choose to not benefit from its effect when played but do so later.
Or
2) You can choose to benefit from its effect or not after you play it, but you have to choose to immediately play it?

Applying the effect of a race token is not obligatory.

If it's a Wizard or Ent token, you perform the effect once as soon as you get it (you can't choose to use it later), thereafter it has no effect.

For all the others you benefit from the effect from then on, every time. (e.g take another turn after you build a landmark will apply every time.)

> A question on choosing an alliance token when having 3 different race symbols:

Each player can do this once. Alliance tokens gain is at individual basis, not collectively basis. This is true in other aspects of the game, like the Landmarks coins increase cost per Fortress own.

[resolution-of-effects](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3385606/resolution-of-effects)

> Are effects and bonuses (letâ€™s say on a landmark tile) resolved in any order?

1) Whatever effects are triggered during the current turn, you have to resolve them during the current turn - in any order you want.

2) With the single exception being "take another turn" effects - you just have to wait until you resolve all other effects, then you can take that additional turn (that's because all "take another turn" effects have an explicit condition that you have to finish the current turn first).

> There are purple cards and other effects which cause your opponent to lose coins, but what if your opponent doesn't have any coins?

Cards having fluctuating value/power isn't unique to removal effects, and deciding what to do about cards that are currently weak for you but better for your opponent is a pretty core element of the game.

[removing-fortress](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3390923/removing-fortress)

> The rules say : "An opposing fortress does not trigger a conflict and does not prevent you from placing your Units in the same region. It is therefore possible for both players to be present in the same region. "
So, Is there a conflict in this case, when a fortress is removed from a region where units from both sides are present ?

The rules say "it is possible for both players to be present in the same region." This is because a "fortress" does not engage in combat, so you could have a Fellowship "fortress" and Sauron units (i.e. soldiers) in a single region, thus both players being present in one region. A "fortress" does not allow soldiers from both sides to be present in a single region. Removing a fortress has no effect other than one player losing the fortress.

Example: I have the token where yellow cards move the ring + yellow cards give me an extra turn. Now, when I buy the yellow card, I also move the ring onto the extra turn symbol on the ring track. Thus given me 1 extra turn from the track and one extra turn from playing a yellow card.

You get only 1 extra turn.
You cannot add extra turns.
