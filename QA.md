> In the landmark tile, what is the use of the round symbols ?

For that first yellow one, It's a reminder that you need to pay 1 coin for each fortress you already have on the map. So for your first landmark, the round symbol costs nothing since you have no fortresses.
For the rest of the symbols, it's the cost to build. The skills required to put into play.

> When you have the halfling alliance power that grants 3 coins whenever you play a card with a chain symbol on it. When does that trigger?
> 1. When you play a card with a chain symbol at the top right of it (the chain trigger)
> 2. When you play a card with a chain symbol that shows the replacement, cost on the left middle of the card (the chain resolution)
> 3. Or both?

The ability says:
"When you play a card using a chaining
symbol, take 3 Coins from the reserve."

"Using" chaining symbol, not "with" chaining symbol anywhere on it - so it's your option #2: whenever you play a new card for free because you have the required card to chain it from, and avoid the resource requirements/cost.

> Does the Sauron player always go first in chapter 1,2,3

The turn order carries on between chapters. So if player A is the last active player in chapter 1, player B will start chapter 2. But if a player is the last active in chapter 1 and gets an extra turn playing the last card, he starts the next chapter. But don't forget there's no obligation to take an extra turn.

> Let's say I play green card. As a consequence I choose Dwarves token "When you play a Green card, also complete 2 movements on the central board.". Do I get 2 movements right now or only next time green card is played?

No, because you already played the green card BEFORE the token's ability became active.
You only trigger the effect from the Dwarves token after you have the token. Get the token first and thereafter drawing green cards triggers it.

> If you have the eagle symbol plus say a hobbit and human does this trigger the bonus for 3 different symbols? There would then only be 2 alliance tokens to reveal and choose from, or do you wait until you have three different race symbols from green cards before triggering the bonus?

No it doesn't. 
Eagle only count as a race symbol when you check the race victory.
It doesn't count for the 3 different races bonus.

> If I have a tile granting me another turn after buying a landmark, do I have to take another turn?

it's optional. The wording "you may" clearly means you can do it or not, it's your choice.

[grey-havens-landmark](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3388590/grey-havens-landmark)

> If you buy the Grey Havens landmark do you have to pick the top 2 token from the same race and then choose one? Or can you pick 1 top token from a race and 1 top token from another race (then choose one)?

The "top 2 tokens of any race" should be from the same race. This is easy to catch, because this shouldn't allow you to take 12 tokens, just 2. If it's not like this, the wording could be better.

> can you play a landmark and therefore place a fortress in a place with enemy units already present there?

Yes, opponent Fortresses and units may coexist, just opponent units get into conflict.
